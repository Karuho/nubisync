# Phase 4 — Remote baseline before local filesystem reconciliation

## Phase 4A — Metadata-only Drive inventory probe

The incremental Drive change feed only contains items that changed after a checkpoint.
It cannot reconstruct the complete pre-existing remote hierarchy by itself.

Before NubiSync creates or modifies local files, Phase 4A deliberately exercises
`files.list` for the first time as a metadata-only inventory probe.

Command:

`nubisync drive inventory`

The probe:

- uses the existing `drive.metadata.readonly` scope
- searches the Drive space for non-trashed items owned by the current user
- follows `nextPageToken` until the inventory is complete
- counts ordinary files and folders
- counts provider-native Google Workspace items and shortcuts separately
- does not persist filenames or Drive IDs yet
- does not change the existing Drive change cursor
- does not modify the durable remote-event journal
- does not request file contents
- performs no Drive write

Provider-native Google Workspace files remain outside the initial ordinary-file
sync scope and will require explicit export/import semantics in a later phase.

Phase 4B will persist the validated ordinary-file/folder inventory through a
crash-safe staging snapshot before any local filesystem reconciliation is enabled.
